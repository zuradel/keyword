Sometimes, you don’t realize how much you’ve been holding on to until it all slips away
They say time heals all wounds, but some scars never fade
It’s hard to move on when everything around you reminds you of what was lost
You can love someone and still let them go It doesn’t mean you stop caring, it just means you’re strong enough to walk away
Heartbreak teaches you that not everyone who enters your life is meant to stay forever
We give so much of ourselves to others, forgetting that we need to preserve some of it for ourselves
Sometimes the hardest thing is learning to be okay without the one who made you feel whole
Maybe the reason we hold on to memories is because we think we might find them again
The heart has a way of healing itself, but only if you let it
People don’t always leave you because they stop loving you Sometimes they leave because they stop hurting
Some people are just passing through your life to teach you something, not to stay forever
It’s funny how love can turn into something you’re afraid of
Sometimes the person you love most is the one who can hurt you the deepest
Maybe it wasn’t meant to last forever, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t worth it
Loving someone is never a waste, even if it ends in heartbreak
There’s a certain kind of strength in letting go, even when you don’t want to
I’ve learned that sometimes, letting go is the only way to make space for better things
The hardest part of letting go is realizing you may never get the closure you need
It’s easy to love when things are going right, but it takes true courage to love when everything feels wrong
Not every love story is meant to have a happy ending, but that doesn’t make it any less meaningful
The hardest part about moving on is accepting that things will never be the same again
We are taught to love others, but no one teaches us how to love ourselves after heartbreak
Sometimes you have to break to rebuild yourself into someone stronger
Heartbreak doesn’t make you weak; it teaches you to be strong enough to start over
Love is a beautiful thing, but sometimes it’s not enough to make things work
Sometimes, the end of one chapter is just the beginning of something better
We all try to hold on to what we once had, not realizing that letting go could be the best thing for us
Not all relationships are meant to last, but every relationship teaches you something valuable
It’s funny how you can love someone with all your heart and still end up with nothing
When you love someone, you don’t expect them to hurt you But sometimes, they do, and it changes everything
It’s not about forgetting the past, it’s about learning to live with it and moving forward
Love should never feel like a burden, but sometimes it does And it’s okay to walk away
You can’t fix someone who doesn’t want to be fixed, no matter how much you love them
Sometimes, you realize that the hardest part of letting go is not losing the person, but losing the future you imagined with them
The truth is, some people are just meant to be a chapter in your life, not the whole story
The hardest thing to do after heartbreak is not to forget, but to forgive
It’s amazing how a single person can change your entire world, and then one day, they’re just a memory
You don’t always need closure to move on Sometimes, all you need is the courage to walk away
You can’t change the past, but you can change how you move forward from it
Heartbreak makes you realize that some things just aren’t meant to be
It’s strange how someone can make you feel like the center of the universe, and then, without warning, they’re gone
Sometimes the person who loves you most is the one who causes the most pain
A broken heart doesn’t mean you’ve failed at love; it just means you’ve loved deeply
When you lose someone, it feels like you’ve lost a part of yourself But what if that part wasn’t really meant to stay?
Heartbreak doesn’t mean the end of love; it just means it’s time to find new ways to love yourself
The most painful part of a breakup isn’t the goodbye It’s realizing the love you had wasn’t enough to keep them
Sometimes, the person you need to let go of is yourself – the version of you who was waiting for them to change
Love isn’t about being perfect for someone; it’s about being real and understanding when things aren’t working
A broken heart is like a puzzle – it takes time, patience, and effort to put it back together
In the end, the only person who can heal your heart is you
Sometimes the hardest part isn’t missing them, it’s missing the version of yourself that was with them
Heartbreak is a reminder that we are strong enough to survive even the hardest of storms
Letting go is hard, but staying in a place that doesn’t serve you is even harder
Sometimes, the best thing you can do for yourself is to walk away from the person who was holding you back
When you love someone so much that it hurts, it’s time to ask yourself if it’s worth the pain
Love is not about finding the perfect person, but about being strong enough to let go when it’s no longer working
Heartbreak doesn’t make you weak, it makes you wiser, and it teaches you to value yourself more
Sometimes, the hardest part of letting go is accepting that it wasn’t your fault
The beauty of love is that it teaches you to grow, even when it hurts
It’s amazing how much strength you can find in yourself once you stop depending on others for your happiness
Sometimes, you have to lose yourself to find the version of you that you’ve been ignoring
When you lose someone, you also lose the person you thought you were with them But that doesn’t mean you can’t find yourself again
It’s not the end of the world, it’s just the end of this chapter And new chapters are waiting to be written
Love shouldn’t be hard; if it feels like a constant struggle, maybe it’s time to let go
The person you thought you couldn’t live without becomes the person you realize you can live without
We all need to learn that sometimes walking away is the most loving thing we can do for ourselves
Love can be beautiful, but it’s okay to acknowledge when it’s no longer healthy for you
You can’t change the past, but you can shape your future with the lessons you’ve learned from it
Heartbreak isn’t the end; it’s the beginning of a new chapter in your life
When the right person comes along, you’ll realize why it never worked with the wrong ones
Sometimes we stay in relationships because we’re afraid of being alone, but being alone is the best time to find yourself again
The hardest part of any journey is not the beginning or the end, but the courage to keep going in the middle
Heartbreak is not a failure; it’s just proof that you were brave enough to love
Every goodbye makes space for something better to enter your life
Moving on doesn’t mean you’ve stopped loving them It just means you’ve stopped letting their absence define you
It’s funny how the person who made you feel most alive can also be the one who drains the life out of you
Some wounds are meant to heal, but some scars will stay with you forever And that’s okay
Heartbreak makes you stronger, even if you don’t realize it right away
When you love someone, you risk losing them But that’s the price of loving deeply
A broken heart is not the end of the world It’s just the beginning of healing
Letting go is hard, but holding on to something that’s not working is even harder
Woke up to a beautiful day and already feeling like the world is on my side
Coffee first, then conquer the world
Some days are meant for sleeping in, and I’m here for it
Life is too short to be anything but happy
I could be doing nothing all day and still call it a good day
Nothing beats the feeling of finding a new favorite snack
When life gives you lemons, just add sugar and make lemonade
Caffeine and good vibes only
Feeling extra today, might just eat dessert first
Who needs sleep when you can have snacks and Netflix?
Today’s goal: 1 Be happy 2 Repeat
Just realized life is better when I’m smiling So I’ll smile more
Caught myself smiling for no reason maybe life’s just good
Happiness is waking up to no alarms
I could be adulting, but I’d rather be napping
Life’s too short to not eat pizza
Why stress when you can binge-watch your favorite show and eat popcorn?
Some days are meant for doing absolutely nothing Today is one of those days
My mood is determined by how many snacks are around me
Life’s little pleasures: food, friends, and a good meme
Every day is a good day when you’re surrounded by good people
Stress? Never heard of her Just enjoying life one snack at a time
When in doubt, take a nap
If you don’t laugh at least once a day, you’re doing it wrong
Some days are made for snacks and Netflix Today is that day
Woke up, coffee in hand, ready to take on the world
Good vibes are my superpower
Today’s agenda: Laugh until my stomach hurts
I’m not saying I’m a morning person, but coffee helps a lot
Why stress when you can just vibe?
Nothing like a chill day to reset your mood
I live for those moments when you find a song that perfectly fits your mood
Is it too early to talk about pizza? Asking for a friend
Waking up to a full snack cupboard is the best kind of surprise
If I had a dollar for every time I smiled today, I’d be rich
Life is better with a cup of tea and a good book
The best days are those spent doing absolutely nothing
Happiness is found in the little things: like finding an extra fry in your bag
It’s a good day to be happy and lazy at the same time
Every morning is a fresh start But also coffee first
Dreaming big and snacking bigger
How to be happy: 1 Wake up 2 Have coffee 3 Eat snacks 4 Repeat
I’m not saying today will be perfect, but it’s gonna be good enough
Feeling good and it’s not even noon yet
Today’s mood: Just here for the snacks and vibes
Nothing beats the feeling of finding a comfy spot and doing absolutely nothing
Today’s goal: Smile more, stress less
The best part of the day is when you realize it’s still early enough for a nap
Some days are for adventure, others are for naps Today is for naps
Life is a mix of good vibes, good food, and good people Let’s keep it that way
I’m not lazy, I’m just on energy-saving mode
If life gets tough, just remember: there’s always chocolate
When you realize you’ve been laughing for 10 minutes straight that’s the best feeling
Happiness is a warm blanket, a good movie, and snacks
Sometimes, the best therapy is a walk with friends and lots of snacks
No such thing as a bad day when you have good food around
Waking up early just to go back to sleep in an hour worth it
Today’s motto: Eat Laugh Nap Repeat
Good things happen when you smile at life
Just here for the good times, good friends, and good food
Some days are made for adventure, but today I’m just here for the snacks
The world is better when you find a meme that makes you laugh out loud
Today is a good day to take it easy and enjoy the little things
Found a new snack, and I’m not sharing #SorryNotSorry
Trying to be productive, but my bed looks way too inviting
When in doubt, just add more snacks
Sometimes you just have to let go and enjoy a lazy day
Started the day with coffee and positive thoughts So far, so good
Living my best life, one snack at a time
The best moments are those when you’re doing absolutely nothing but loving life
You know it’s a good day when you can’t stop smiling for no reason
Waking up to good vibes, coffee, and the promise of a relaxing day
Today’s to-do list: Be happy, have fun, eat snacks
A little bit of coffee, a lot of positive energy, and I’m good to go
Life is better with a little extra sugar and a lot of laughs
The perfect day: food, friends, and a comfy spot to relax
Who needs a vacation when you can chill at home with your favorite snacks?
Sometimes, you have to let yourself do absolutely nothing and call it self-care
Just another day of eating snacks and enjoying life
Today is a good day for naps, snacks, and happy thoughts
No matter what happens, I’ll find a way to smile
The best way to start your day? A cup of coffee and a good playlist
Good vibes only Let’s keep it simple today
Happiness is realizing you’re doing exactly what you want to be doing
Snacks + Netflix = The perfect day
Woke up and immediately thought about food Priorities
A good day starts with coffee and a smile
Just here for the good vibes and bad jokes
Some days are made for doing nothing This is one of those days
You can’t go wrong with a lazy day and lots of food
If you’re not smiling, you’re doing it wrong
Nothing beats a lazy day with all your favorite things
Some days, the best thing to do is just laugh and eat snacks
Today’s goal: Eat, laugh, repeat
Life is too short to not enjoy every moment
The best part of my day is when I realize I have no plans
When in doubt, just eat more snacks and chill
Feeling good, feeling great Now where’s the pizza?
Today’s motto: Smile first, deal with the rest later
Waking up to coffee and realizing you have no responsibilities today? Best feeling ever
When you laugh so hard, it makes everything feel right in the world
Starting the day with some good vibes and snacks
I’m all about those chill days and positive vibes
Not much can beat a lazy day with lots of snacks
No stress, just smiles and snacks all day long
Feeling extra happy today Not sure why, but I’ll take it
Finding joy in the little things is my secret to happiness
Life is what you make it, so I’m making it a whole lot of fun

Good vibes are contagious, so I’m spreading them everywhere

Chia tay rồi, giờ chỉ còn lại những đêm dài tự hỏi tại sao
Tình yêu không phải lúc nào cũng đẹp, nhưng em vẫn yêu anh nhiều lắm
Em tưởng mình đủ mạnh mẽ, nhưng sao giờ vẫn yếu đuối vì anh?
Thà không yêu còn hơn yêu rồi lại đau
Anh đi rồi, chỉ còn lại em trong những kí ức đau đớn
Chẳng ai hiểu được cảm giác khi yêu một người không yêu mình
Em cứ nghĩ sẽ có một kết thúc đẹp, ai ngờ chỉ là sự ra đi lặng lẽ
Yêu anh như thế, sao giờ chỉ còn lại nỗi buồn
Mỗi lần nhớ anh, là mỗi lần trái tim em đau nhói
Yêu thương đó giờ hóa thành khoảng trống không thể lấp đầy
Cứ nghĩ mình sẽ hạnh phúc, ai ngờ chỉ là mơ mộng
Em vẫn nhớ anh, dù chúng ta đã chia tay rồi
Tình yêu chẳng phải lúc nào cũng hoàn hảo, nhưng em vẫn yêu anh
Đừng yêu ai khi trong lòng họ không có chỗ cho mình
Ngày em không còn yêu anh nữa, em vẫn nhớ từng khoảnh khắc bên nhau
Dù anh đã đi, nhưng ký ức về anh vẫn không phai mờ
Anh là tất cả, giờ đây chẳng còn gì cả
Chia tay xong rồi mới biết, yêu một người không dễ dàng
Mỗi lần cười, lòng em lại đau đớn vì anh
Em đã cố quên anh, nhưng mỗi lần nhớ lại vẫn không thể
Có những người đến rồi đi, nhưng họ vẫn để lại vết thương trong trái tim mình
Yêu quá nhiều rồi lại thấy mình quá ngu ngốc
Tình yêu không có hồi đáp, chỉ còn lại sự cô đơn
Em từng nghĩ mình sẽ không sống nổi nếu thiếu anh, giờ đây em vẫn sống, nhưng chẳng còn vui nữa
Chúng ta yêu nhau, sao giờ lại như hai người xa lạ?
Có những nỗi đau, chẳng thể nói thành lời
Nhớ anh, nhưng vẫn phải để anh đi
Tình yêu ấy, giờ đây chẳng thể gọi tên
Chỉ còn lại những giọt nước mắt mà anh không thấy
Tình yêu mà em dành cho anh, giờ đây em phải mang đi đâu?
Yêu anh như vậy, cuối cùng cũng chỉ là một mình
Chỉ là một người qua đường trong câu chuyện tình của anh
Mỗi lần nhìn vào ký ức, em lại thấy mình yếu đuối
Cảm giác cô đơn, chỉ có mình em và những nỗi buồn
Cố gắng quên đi, nhưng sao nó vẫn luôn trở lại
Em yêu anh bằng cả trái tim, nhưng anh không bao giờ hiểu
Một lần thôi, em chỉ muốn anh quay lại
Không phải lúc nào yêu cũng có được kết quả đẹp
Yêu em, nhưng sao anh cứ rời xa
Có những lời chưa kịp nói, giờ chỉ còn lại im lặng
Em không biết phải làm sao, khi mọi thứ chỉ còn lại sự xa cách
Cảm giác bị bỏ rơi, đau lắm
Anh là lý do em cười, giờ đây lại là lý do em khóc
Khi tình yêu chỉ còn là một ký ức mơ hồ
Chia tay nhưng sao em vẫn còn yêu anh như lúc ban đầu?
Em nhớ anh, dù biết rằng chúng ta không thể quay lại
Tình yêu ấy, giờ chỉ còn lại trong lòng em thôi
Từng là tất cả, giờ chẳng còn gì cả
Yêu anh quá nhiều, đến nỗi không biết mình đang làm gì
Bây giờ em chỉ biết nhìn anh hạnh phúc bên người khác mà thôi
Không phải em không cố gắng, mà là chúng ta không thể đi chung con đường
Tình yêu không phải lúc nào cũng đẹp, nhưng em vẫn hy vọng
Đôi khi, yêu một người chính là tự làm mình đau
Anh ra đi, để lại em trong những nỗi nhớ không thể xóa
Tình yêu của chúng ta, giờ đây chỉ còn là những vết thương khó lành
Cảm giác bị bỏ lại, chưa bao giờ đau đớn đến vậy
Mọi thứ đã thay đổi, nhưng em vẫn nhớ anh
Đôi khi, chỉ cần một cái ôm của anh là đủ, nhưng giờ đây chỉ còn lại khoảng trống
Chia tay rồi, nhưng sao vẫn cảm thấy như đang yêu anh
Tình yêu ấy, giờ chỉ còn lại một màu xám trong trái tim em
Có những lúc, em muốn quên anh, nhưng anh vẫn hiện hữu trong giấc mơ
Mỗi ngày trôi qua, em lại nhớ anh nhiều hơn
Tình yêu không phải lúc nào cũng bền vững, và em phải chấp nhận
Lúc trước anh là tất cả, giờ chỉ còn lại nỗi buồn vô tận
Em không thể quên anh, dù có muốn đến đâu
Dù anh không ở bên, nhưng hình bóng anh vẫn mãi theo em
Chia tay là một sự kết thúc, nhưng tình yêu vẫn mãi trong lòng em
Làm sao để quên được những kỷ niệm ngọt ngào đã qua?
Anh từng nói yêu em, nhưng giờ lại chỉ còn là lời nói gió bay
Chia tay xong rồi mới hiểu, tình yêu không phải lúc nào cũng đẹp như trong tưởng tượng
Yêu anh nhiều đến nỗi, em chẳng thể buông tay
Em không thể quên được anh, dù có bao nhiêu lần cố gắng
Anh là tất cả, nhưng giờ chỉ còn là quá khứ
Tình yêu của em dành cho anh, giờ đã trở thành nỗi đau
Chúng ta đã từng rất gần, sao giờ lại là hai người xa lạ?
Anh không nói lời chia tay, nhưng em vẫn cảm nhận được sự ra đi
Tình yêu ấy, giờ chỉ còn lại trong ký ức mà thôi
Chúng ta từng yêu nhau, giờ lại chẳng còn gì
Dù anh đã đi, nhưng tình yêu của em dành cho anh vẫn không thể phai
Em không cần quá nhiều, chỉ cần anh yêu em thôi
Mất anh, em như mất đi một phần của chính mình
Tình yêu không có hồi đáp, chỉ có sự im lặng
Yêu anh, rồi lại mất anh Đó là điều em không bao giờ ngờ tới
Anh không cần biết em đau đớn như thế nào, em chỉ biết yêu anh
Chia tay rồi, nhưng trong lòng em vẫn giữ anh
Em yêu anh, nhưng anh lại không cần em nữa
Mỗi lần nhớ về anh, trái tim lại đau thắt
Yêu anh, nhưng chẳng thể giữ anh lại
Có những nỗi đau chỉ có thể tự mình gặm nhấm
Dù em có cố gắng, nhưng anh vẫn xa em quá xa
Anh ra đi, em chỉ biết tiếc nuối
Tình yêu là gì khi hai trái tim không cùng nhịp đập?
Anh yêu em, nhưng sao em không cảm nhận được?
Chia tay xong, mọi thứ chỉ còn lại sự tĩnh lặng
Em luôn hy vọng anh quay lại, nhưng hy vọng chỉ là hy vọng mà thôi
Tình yêu không phải lúc nào cũng đẹp, nhưng em vẫn muốn yêu
Có những lúc em muốn quên anh, nhưng càng quên lại càng nhớ
Khi chia tay, em không còn biết phải làm gì
Em yêu anh, nhưng anh lại không yêu em
Tình yêu không thể cứu vãn, chúng ta phải buông tay
Anh ra đi, để lại em trong nỗi nhớ vô tận
Anh là lý do em cười, nhưng giờ lại là lý do em khóc
Em muốn quên, nhưng trái tim không thể làm được điều đó
Chia tay, nhưng sao vẫn thấy nhói lòng mỗi khi nhớ về anh
Mất anh, em mất cả một thế giới
Cô đơn khiến ta hiểu rằng sự cần thiết của tình yêu và sự chấp nhận
Tự lập là cách để em trưởng thành và trở nên độc lập trong cuộc sống, không còn phụ thuộc vào người khác để quyết định cho mình
Cuộc sống lành mạnh là sự kết hợp của những lựa chọn thông minh trong vi
Cuộc sống lành mạnh bắt đầu bằng việc tôn trọng và quan tâm đến bản thân mình
Em biết rằng anh không thể quay trở lại, nhưng em vẫn hy vọng rằng một ngày nào đó, anh sẽ nhớ lại tình yêu của chúng ta
Hai năm tình lận đận hai đứa đành xa nhau

Đôi khi ta cứ cố gắng mỉm cười để che giấu nỗi buồn trong lòng
Mưa rơi ngoài hiên, còn tôi ngồi đây đếm từng kỷ niệm đã qua
Đêm dài cô đơn với những suy nghĩ không tên gọi về một người
Có những nỗi nhớ cứ âm thầm lớn dần theo thời gian trôi qua
Lặng lẽ nhìn tin nhắn cuối cùng, rồi xóa hết mọi kỷ niệm về nhau
Mùa thu đến rồi đi, chỉ còn lại nỗi nhớ mông lung trong tim
Một mình bước đi trên con đường quen thuộc ngày nào với người ấy
Yêu thương đã cạn, chỉ còn lại những vết thương lòng không lành được
Giữa phố đông người mà sao lòng vẫn thấy cô đơn đến lạ thường
Nước mắt lặng thầm rơi trong đêm vắng không người biết, không ai hay
Thời gian trôi qua nhưng nỗi đau vẫn còn nguyên vẹn trong trái tim
Cười thật tươi để không ai biết mình đang buồn và cô đơn nhiều
Sóng vỗ rì rào bên bờ biển, còn tim thì tan vỡ từng cơn đau
Mùa thu về mang theo những nỗi buồn không tên và nỗi nhớ người
Thả trôi ký ức về một tình yêu không trọn vẹn trong đêm tối
Đêm về một mình ngắm trăng và nhớ người xa xôi nơi chân trời
Có những nỗi đau chỉ mình ta hiểu được thôi, không ai thấu được đâu
Bước chân mỏi mệt trên đường về đơn độc giữa phố phường tấp nập
Mưa rơi làm nhòe đi những dòng tin nhắn cuối cùng của đôi ta
Giấu nỗi buồn sau nụ cười để không ai thương xót những ngày qua
Mái tóc em nHư Ngàn Sao chìm tronG suối hơi thở em hòa nụ hôn vÀng đắm đuối đôi lúc em sầU khi nắng ngả màu tiếng Khóc Em như gIọt mưa giữa đêm naO
Xuân này nơj ấy em có trông gjó xuân man mát lòng phơj phớj em có nguyện mong trọn tình hồng?
Đôi khi ta cứ cố gắng mỉm cười để che giấu nỗi buồn
Mưa rơi ngoài hiên, còn tôi ngồi đây đếm từng kỷ niệm
Đêm dài cô đơn với những suy nghĩ không tên gọi
Có những nỗi nhớ cứ âm thầm lớn dần theo thời gian
Lặng lẽ nhìn tin nhắn cuối, rồi xóa hết mọi kỷ niệm
Mùa thu đến rồi đi, chỉ còn lại nỗi nhớ mông lung
Một mình bước đi trên con đường quen thuộc ngày nào
Yêu thương đã cạn, chỉ còn lại những vết thương lòng
Giữa phố đông người mà sao lòng vẫn thấy cô đơn
Nước mắt lặng thầm rơi trong đêm vắng không người biết
Thời gian trôi qua nhưng nỗi đau vẫn còn nguyên vẹn
Cười thật tươi để không ai biết mình đang buồn
Sóng vỗ rì rào, còn tim thì tan vỡ từng cơn
Mùa thu về mang theo những nỗi buồn không tên
Thả trôi ký ức về một tình yêu không trọn vẹn
Đêm về một mình ngắm trăng và nhớ người xa
Có những nỗi đau chỉ mình ta hiểu được thôi
Bước chân mỏi mệt trên đường về đơn độc
Mưa rơi làm nhòe đi những dòng tin nhắn cuối
Giấu nỗi buồn sau nụ cười để không ai thương xót
Ngồi đếm từng phút giây trôi qua trong cô đơn
Nhớ một người không thể quên dù đã xa
Lạc lõng giữa dòng đời với trái tim tan vỡ
Đường về nhà sao hôm nay dài đến thế
Chỉ còn lại mình ta với những kỷ niệm buồn
Đôi mắt buồn khi nhìn về phía xa xăm
Nỗi nhớ cứ lớn dần theo từng ngày trôi qua
Lặng im nhìn mưa rơi và nghĩ về người
Có những lúc chỉ muốn khóc thật nhiều cho nhẹ lòng
Tình yêu tan vỡ như sương mai buổi sớm
Mệt mỏi quá, chỉ muốn ngủ một giấc thật dài
Đêm nay trăng sáng nhưng lòng tôi tối đen
Nhớ những ngày xưa khi ta còn bên nhau
Giờ đây chỉ còn lại mình ta với bóng tối
Từng bước chân về, nặng trĩu những nỗi buồn
Có những nỗi đau không thể nói thành lời
Mưa vẫn rơi, tim vẫn đau như ngày nào
Lạc lối giữa những kỷ niệm không thể quên
Đôi khi chỉ muốn quên đi tất cả để bắt đầu
Nỗi cô đơn cứ lớn dần theo năm tháng
Nhìn lại quá khứ chỉ thấy toàn những vết thương
Mỗi sáng thức dậy vẫn nhớ về người ấy
Có những yêu thương không thể nói ra được
Ngồi đếm từng phút giây trôi qua trong cô đơn giữa đêm khuya lạnh giá
Nhớ một người không thể quên dù đã xa, dù thời gian đã qua rồi
Lạc lõng giữa dòng đời với trái tim tan vỡ không thể hàn gắn được
Đường về nhà sao hôm nay dài đến thế, chỉ có bóng mình lặng lẽ
Những giọt nước mắt lặng thầm rơi trong đêm không ai hay, không ai biết
Mỗi bước chân về nhà là một lần nhớ về kỷ niệm ngày xưa
Nỗi nhớ cứ lớn dần theo từng ngày trôi qua không nguôi ngoai được
Lặng im nhìn mưa rơi và nghĩ về người, về những ngày đã qua
Có những lúc chỉ muốn khóc thật nhiều cho vơi bớt nỗi đau lòng
Tình yêu tan vỡ như sương mai buổi sớm, mong manh và vô định
Mệt mỏi quá, chỉ muốn ngủ một giấc thật dài để quên tất cả
Đêm nay trăng sáng nhưng lòng tôi tối đen như mực không thấy lối
Nhớ những ngày xưa khi ta còn bên nhau, còn những phút giây hạnh phúc
Từng bước chân về, nặng trĩu những nỗi buồn không tên không tuổi
Có những nỗi đau không thể nói thành lời, chỉ biết giữ trong tim
Mưa vẫn rơi, tim vẫn đau như ngày đầu ta xa nhau vậy
Đôi khi chỉ muốn quên đi tất cả để bắt đầu lại từ con số không
Nỗi cô đơn cứ lớn dần theo năm tháng như bóng tối không散 tan
Nhìn lại quá khứ chỉ thấy toàn những vết thương chưa kịp lành
Mỗi sáng thức dậy vẫn nhớ về người ấy dù biết không còn gì nữa
Anh vẫn thường ngồi ở quán cà phê này, nhìn người qua lại và nhớ về em
Chúng ta đã từng hứa bên nhau mãi mãi, vậy mà giờ đây lại là người dưng
Tôi vẫn thường tự hỏi vì sao cuộc tình của chúng ta lại kết thúc như vậy
Em biết không, mỗi buổi chiều mưa anh vẫn ngồi đây chờ một bóng hình quen thuộc
Người ta nói thời gian sẽ xóa nhòa tất cả, nhưng sao anh vẫn nhớ em đến thế
Tôi vẫn thường một mình đi trên những con phố, nơi chúng ta đã từng đi cùng nhau
Em vẫn giữ thói quen uống một tách cà phê đắng mỗi sáng và nhớ về anh
Chúng ta đã có những khoảng thời gian thật đẹp, nhưng giờ chỉ còn là kỷ niệm
Anh vẫn thường ngồi ngắm hoàng hôn một mình và tự hỏi em giờ đang ở đâu
Tôi đã học cách sống một mình, nhưng vẫn không thể quên được những ngày có người
Em vẫn thường đi ngang qua những nơi xưa, dù biết sẽ không còn gặp được anh
Người ta bảo rằng sau cơn mưa trời sẽ sáng, nhưng tôi vẫn đang đợi ánh nắng
Anh vẫn giữ thói quen đọc những tin nhắn cũ, dù biết rằng không còn gì nữa
Tôi vẫn thường tự hỏi liệu em có nhớ về những kỷ niệm chúng ta đã có
Em vẫn hay ngồi một mình trong căn phòng vắng, nhìn những tấm ảnh ngày xưa
Chúng ta đã từng nghĩ rằng tình yêu sẽ vượt qua tất cả, nhưng cuối cùng vẫn buông tay
Anh vẫn thường đi ngang qua con phố nhỏ, nơi lần đầu tiên chúng ta gặp nhau
Tôi vẫn nhớ như in những lời hứa năm xưa, dù biết rằng không thể thực hiện được
Tôi vẫn ngồi đây đếm từng giọt nước mắt rơi, dù biết rằng người không còn quay lại
Em lặng lẽ bước đi trên con đường quen thuộc, nơi chúng ta từng có những kỷ niệm đẹp
Tôi vẫn ngồi đây đếm từng giọt nước mắt rơi trong đêm vắng
Em lặng lẽ bước đi trên con đường quen thuộc ngày nào
Anh vẫn thường ngồi ở quán cà phê này nhớ về em
Chúng ta đã từng hứa bên nhau, vậy mà giờ là người dưng
Tôi vẫn thường tự hỏi vì sao tình yêu lại kết thúc như vậy
Em biết không, mỗi chiều mưa anh vẫn ngồi đây chờ em về
Người ta nói thời gian sẽ xóa nhòa, nhưng anh vẫn nhớ em
Tôi vẫn một mình đi trên những con phố chúng ta đã qua
Em vẫn giữ thói quen uống cà phê đắng và nhớ về anh
Chúng ta đã có những ngày tháng đẹp, giờ chỉ còn kỷ niệm
Anh vẫn thường ngắm hoàng hôn một mình và nghĩ về em
Tôi đã học cách sống một mình nhưng vẫn không quên được người
Em vẫn thường đi ngang qua những nơi xưa ta từng đến
Người ta bảo sau cơn mưa trời lại sáng, nhưng tôi vẫn đợi
Anh vẫn giữ những tin nhắn cũ dù biết không còn gì nữa
Tôi vẫn thường nhớ về những kỷ niệm chúng ta đã có
Em vẫn hay ngồi một mình nhìn những tấm ảnh ngày xưa
Chúng ta đã từng nghĩ tình yêu sẽ mãi mãi bên nhau
Anh vẫn thường đi ngang qua nơi đầu tiên gặp em
Tôi vẫn nhớ những lời hứa năm xưa dù biết không thể
Em vẫn đứng đợi dưới mưa như ngày nào ta gặp nhau
Anh vẫn tìm hương cà phê quen thuộc mỗi sáng thức giấc
Tôi vẫn giữ thói quen đi dạo mỗi chiều như ngày có người
Em vẫn hay nhìn điện thoại chờ một tin nhắn từ anh
Tôi cứ ngỡ cuộc đời buồn lắm, ai ngờ gặp được bạn khiến tôi cười đau cả bụng mỗi ngày
Em bảo anh là định mệnh của đời em, nhưng thực ra anh chỉ là người đến trả nợ duyên thôi
Anh cứ nghĩ mình đẹp trai lắm, cho đến khi gặp gương thì mới biết mình tự tin tới mức nào
Tôi cứ tưởng mình sẽ cô đơn mãi, ai ngờ gặp được bạn khiến tôi muốn độc thân cả đời
Em bảo với anh là em xinh đẹp nhất thế giới, nhưng anh biết em chưa gặp mẹ anh rồi
Cuộc đời này ngắn lắm, đừng nghiêm túc quá, cười lên đi kẻo không kịp chụp ảnh selfie đâu
Tôi cứ nghĩ mình đã đủ điên rồi, cho đến khi gặp được bạn mới biết mình còn quá bình thường
Anh bảo yêu em nhất trên đời, nhưng sao cứ thấy anh like ảnh gái xinh trên Facebook hoài
Em tưởng mình là công chúa của anh, ai ngờ anh còn cả một vương quốc các nàng công chúa khác
Tôi cứ nghĩ mình đã đủ lười, cho đến khi gặp bạn mới biết thế nào là nghệ thuật nằm im
Bạn bảo mình là người hoàn hảo nhất, nhưng thực ra là chưa thấy mình lúc đói thôi
Anh cứ nghĩ mình là số một, cho đến khi gặp được em mới biết mình là số không tròn trĩnh
Tôi cứ tưởng mình đã đủ khó tính, cho đến khi gặp bạn mới biết còn có người khó hơn
Anh bảo em là duy nhất, nhưng hóa ra trong điện thoại anh còn cả một bộ sưu tập người duy nhất
Em nghĩ mình đã đủ lầy lội, đến khi gặp anh mới biết thế nào là chuyên gia tấu hài
Bạn nói mình là người hoàn hảo, nhưng chắc chưa thấy mình lúc ngủ dậy buổi sáng đâu
Tôi cứ nghĩ mình đã đủ điên với tình yêu, cho đến khi thấy bạn nhắn tin cho crush
Anh bảo chỉ yêu mình em, nhưng sao danh bạ điện thoại toàn "Em yêu" với "Bé iu" thế
Em tưởng mình là người duy nhất trong tim anh, ai ngờ tim anh rộng như quảng trường Ba Đình
Bạn nói mình là người đặc biệt, nhưng có lẽ chưa biết mình còn đặc biệt hơn thế nào
Tôi cứ nghĩ mình đã đủ mập, đến khi gặp bạn mới thấy mình vẫn còn cơ hội
Anh bảo sẽ yêu em mãi mãi, nhưng có vẻ định nghĩa mãi mãi của anh hơi ngắn
Em tưởng mình là số một của anh, ai ngờ anh còn cả một dãy số từ một đến mười
Bạn nói mình là người thông minh nhất, chắc chưa thấy mình lúc làm toán đâu
Tôi cứ nghĩ mình đã đủ vụng về, cho đến khi thấy bạn tán crush mới thấy nhẹ người
Anh bảo em là cả thế giới, nhưng hình như thế giới của anh có hơi nhiều người
Em tưởng mình là người duy nhất anh quan tâm, ai ngờ anh còn quan tâm cả thế giới
Bạn nói mình là người đáng yêu nhất, chắc chưa soi gương buổi sáng bao giờ
Tôi cứ nghĩ mình đã đủ lười học, đến khi gặp bạn mới biết còn có thần lười
Anh bảo chỉ có em mới hiểu anh, nhưng sao em thấy có quá nhiều người hiểu anh thế
Em tưởng mình là người duy nhất được anh nhớ, ai ngờ anh còn nhớ cả danh bạ điện thoại
Bạn nói mình là người tuyệt vời nhất, chắc chưa thấy mình lúc đói bụng đâu
Hôm nay t buồn vcl, nhưng gặp đc m là cười banh nóc nhà luôn rồi ạ
Đang ngồi ở đây chờ ny rep tin nhắn, ai ngờ chờ tới già vẫn k thấy gì
Bạn thân bảo tui xink gái nhất trường, nhưng chắc chưa gặp crush của tui rồi
Thề luôn, hôm nay buồn đến mức muốn khóc, nhưng gặp đám bạn lại cười như điên
Ngồi đây chờ ny online mà sao thấy time trôi qua chậm quá z trời
Tưởng đi cf với crush sẽ romantic lắm, ai ngờ ngồi im re như tượng đá
Hôm nay t đã nghĩ sẽ là 1 ngày tệ, nhưng gặp m là quên hết mọi thứ
Bạn thân bảo tui là bestie của họ, nhưng sao thấy họ có tới chục bestie thế
Ngồi đây chờ ny rep tin nhắn, mà sao thấy tym đập nhanh hơn cả máy đếm tiền
Tưởng rằng mình đã đủ lầy, ai ngờ gặp đc m còn lầy hơn cả chục lần
Hôm nay t buồn đến mức muốn khóc, nhưng gặp m là cười đến đau cả bụng luôn
Crush bảo t là người đặc biệt, nhưng sao thấy inbox của họ toàn người đặc biệt thế
Ngồi đây chờ ny online mà tim đập thình thịch như trống trường ấy
Tưởng rằng mình đã đủ điên, nhưng gặp m mới biết thế nào là điên thực sự
Hôm nay t định làm người nghiêm túc, nhưng gặp m là quên luôn kế hoạch
Bạn thân bảo t là người quan trọng nhất, nhưng sao thấy họ có cả trăm người quan trọng
Ngồi đây scroll fb cả ngày mà k thấy crush đăng gì mới hết á
Tưởng rằng mình đã đủ lười, nhưng gặp m mới biết thế nào là thần lười
Hôm nay t buồn vcl, ngồi đọc lại tin nhắn cũ mà nước mắt cứ rơi không ngừng
Tưởng rằng mình đã quên được r, ai ngờ vẫn đau khi thấy status mới của người ta
Ngồi một mình trong đêm, lướt fb thấy ảnh người ấy với ny mới mà tim như vỡ
Đã block hết mọi thứ về người đó rồi, vậy mà vẫn cứ nhớ từng kỷ niệm
Thấy người ta hạnh phúc với người mới, còn mình vẫn ngồi đây ôm nỗi nhớ
Crush vừa đăng story với ny mới, còn t thì vẫn f5 hoài tin nhắn cũ
Tưởng rằng mình đã đủ mạnh mẽ, nhưng sao cứ khóc mỗi khi nghe bài hát đó
Ngồi cafe một mình, nhìn couple bên cạnh mà thấy tim mình đau quá
Hôm nay là sinh nhật người ta, nhưng giờ chẳng còn quyền chúc phúc nữa rồi
Mưa rơi ngoài kia, còn nước mắt t thì rơi trong này, nhớ người ta quá
Tưởng rằng time sẽ xóa nhòa tất cả, vậy mà vẫn đau khi thấy tên người ta hiện lên
Ngồi đây nghe playlist cũ, từng bài hát như từng nhát dao đâm vào tim
Thấy status "đã hết yêu" của người ta, mà sao tim mình vẫn đau đến thế
Mỗi lần đi qua con đường cũ, lại nhớ về những kỷ niệm ngày xưa ta đi cùng nhau
Tối nay trời mưa, giống như ngày đó người ta nói lời chia tay
Đã xóa hết ảnh với tin nhắn rồi, nhưng sao kỷ niệm vẫn cứ hiện về hoài
Thấy người ta đổi status "Đang hẹn hò", còn mình vẫn "Độc thân" như ngày nào
Ngồi một mình trong quán quen, nơi ngày xưa hai đứa hay ngồi, giờ chỉ còn mình t
Hôm nay t buồn vcl, ngồi đọc lại tin nhắn cũ mà nước mắt cứ rơi không ngừng, chẳng hiểu sao vẫn nhớ người nhiều thế
Tưởng rằng mình đã quên được r, ai ngờ vẫn đau khi thấy status mới của người ta với ny mới, tim như vỡ từng mảnh
Ngồi một mình trong đêm, lướt fb thấy ảnh người ấy với ny mới, chỉ biết tự an ủi rằng có lẽ đây là điều tốt nhất
Đã block hết mọi thứ về người đó rồi, vậy mà vẫn cứ nhớ từng kỷ niệm, từng nụ cười và cả những lần giận hờn
Thấy người ta hạnh phúc với người mới, còn mình vẫn ngồi đây ôm nỗi nhớ, tự hỏi phải mất bao lâu mới quên được
Crush vừa đăng story với ny mới, còn t thì vẫn f5 hoài tin nhắn cũ, nhìn từng dòng chat mà thấy tim mình đau nhói
Tưởng rằng mình đã đủ mạnh mẽ để vượt qua, nhưng sao cứ khóc mỗi khi nghe bài hát đó, bài hát mà ngày xưa hai đứa cùng nghe
Ngồi cafe một mình ở quán quen, nhìn couple bên cạnh mà thấy tim mình đau quá, tự hỏi khi nào mới hết đau đây
Hôm nay là sinh nhật người ta, nhưng giờ chẳng còn quyền chúc phúc nữa rồi, chỉ biết lặng lẽ nhìn story người ta hạnh phúc
Mưa rơi ngoài kia, còn nước mắt t thì rơi trong này, nhớ người ta quá, nhớ những lần được che ô cho nhau dưới mưa
Hôm nay trời đẹp quá, đi học gặp crush cười với mình một cái là thấy cả ngày tươi như hoa
Vừa được thầy khen trước lớp, về khoe với mẹ xong được thưởng luôn một chuyến đi chơi cuối tuần
Cuối cùng cũng đến ngày nhận lương, tự thưởng cho mình một bữa trà sữa size L siêu to khổng lồ
Hôm nay đi học về sớm, ghé ngang quán trà sữa gặp nguyên team bestie đang ngồi tám chuyện vui cực
Vừa được crush accept friend request, tim đập loạn xạ, cười không ngớt, cả ngày bay bổng trên mây luôn

Vừa nhận được tin đỗ đại học mơ ước, cả nhà mở tiệc ăn mừng, hạnh phúc ngập tràn luôn
Sometimes we force a smile to hide the pain inside our hearts
I sit here counting teardrops while the rain falls outside, remembering all our memories
Lonely nights filled with nameless thoughts about someone special
Some feelings grow silently stronger as time passes by
Quietly looking at the last message, then deleting all memories of us
Autumn comes and goes, leaving behind a vague sense of longing
Walking alone on the familiar street where we used to be together
Love has run dry, leaving only wounds that won't heal
Feeling lonely in a crowded street, strange how that happens
Silent tears fall in the dark night, unknown to anyone
Time passes but the pain remains intact in my heart
Smiling brightly so no one knows I'm sad and lonely
Waves crash on the shore while my heart breaks piece by piece
Autumn returns bringing unnamed sorrows and memories of you
Letting memories drift away of an incomplete love in the dark night
At night I watch the moon alone and miss someone far away
Some pain only we can understand, no one else will know
Tired footsteps on the lonely road home through busy streets
The rain blurs our final messages to each other
Hiding sadness behind a smile so no one pities me
Sitting here counting every passing moment in solitude
Missing someone I can't forget even though they're gone
Lost in life with a broken heart that can't be mended
The way home seems so much longer today
Left alone with nothing but sad memories
Sad eyes gazing into the distance
Longing grows stronger with each passing day
Silently watching the rain and thinking of you
Sometimes just wanting to cry to ease the pain
Love shatters like morning dew
So tired, just wanting to sleep forever
The moon is bright tonight but my heart is dark
Remembering the days when we were together
Now I'm left alone with only shadows
Each step home weighted with unnamed sorrows
Some pain can't be put into words
Rain still falls, heart still aches like the first day
Lost among memories I can't forget
Sometimes just wanting to forget everything and start over
Loneliness grows deeper with each passing year
Looking back only shows wounds that haven't healed
Every morning I wake up still thinking of you
Some love can't be expressed in words
I still sit here counting tears, knowing you'll never
